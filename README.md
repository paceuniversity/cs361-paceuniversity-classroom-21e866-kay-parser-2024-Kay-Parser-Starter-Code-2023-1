# Kay Parser Starter Code
**Starter Code for the Kay Parser assignment**

Replace the code in `TokenStream.java` with the code you implemented in the Kay Scanner (the previous assignment).

Implement `ConcreteSyntax.java` with your Kay Parser. 

Make sure to keep the `package com.scanner.project` line included at the top of both of the starter code files.
